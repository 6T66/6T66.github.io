        Why Would Anyone Want to Read Something so Depressing?

      </h3>

    <p id="p1">

      I honestly have no idea. This book is very long and drawn out, furthermore, certain types of people have <br>
      tendencies to cry and I bet not alot of people in the world want to hear a sad story right now. You could <br>
      get a complete run down on the subject on certain history websites such as<a href="https://www.commonsense.org/education/top-picks/best-history-websites-and-resources"> Commonsense.org</a>. If you are looking<br>
      for a love story however, this would probably just the thing for you! Overall, this book is not to my liking <br>
      simply because I am not into drama and other things concerning the human emotion of "Love" in books. <br>
      Now someone could argue that this is a good way to learn what different people went through but, the purpose <br>
      here is to inform rather than entertain. So no, I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone as it is extremely <br>
      time wasting in terms of the overall efficiency on learning about the subject.

      Historical Accuracy and Context

    </h3>

  <p id="p4">

    Now, to discuss the historical relavence and accuracy/context. When it comes to the overall story, it was <br>
    very realistically represented. At the beginning of the story, Jonas is confused as to why they are being deported.<br>
    He soon learned why and since then was toughened and changed as many were due to mass deportation from their<br>
    homes with no apparent reason why. This demonstrates the numerous hardships that the people from the Baltic <br>
    states. The starvation that Stalin inflicted on the population was horrible yet shown very accurately in the<br>
    story in the case that food was limited to the general population. Through the use of violence and cruelty the<br>
    NKVD portray the treatment that the real people most likely felt as they were oppressed for committing no real<br>
    crimes in the case of trying to go somewhere else or helping someone such as Kostas Vilkas, Lina's father in the<br>
    book, <i>"Between Shades of Gray."</i> Overall, the book does a very good job of portraying the events that happened whether<br>
    someone being starved or beaten or mistreated in any way by the police and military of Russia. I would say, if<br>
    it was shorter would be a very good source of first-person information.

    This is a character profile on Lina Arvydas. Lina was described as a slender frame much like her mother Elena. <br>
    She was apparently beautiful as she fell in love with a described person such as Andrius and apparently married<br>
    him later on. Her emotions on the other hand were often conflicted within the story. With having to leave Andrius<br>
    towards the end, furthermore, she constantly had to think about "Breaking up with him" as their relationship<br>
    might have caused problems later on in the survelliance camps that they were put in after the ordeals in the<br>
    regions of Siberia. Their were many things that Lina did throughout the story that affected the other characters.<br>
    Things including the emotional support that she gave to her mother, Jonas, and the rest of the group. These<br>
    actions kept a large majority of them going. Her inner thoughts were always considerate of others in the fact<br>
    that, unlike the bald man, wanted to see everyone survive the cold and go home to Lithuania. The combination<br>
    of all of these things creates the presence of Lina being a good character in the sense that her intentions<br>
    were always to the best of everyone else first compared to herself.
