        Why Would Anyone Want to Read Something so Depressing?

      </h3>

    <p id="p1">

      I honestly have no idea. This book is very long and drawn out, furthermore, certain types of people have <br>
      tendencies to cry and I bet not alot of people in the world want to hear a sad story right now. You could <br>
      get a complete run down on certain history websites such as<a href="https://www.commonsense.org/education/top-picks/best-history-websites-and-resources"> Commonsense.org</a>. If you are looking<br>
      for a love story however, this would probably just the thing for you! Overall, this book is not to my liking <br>
      simply because I am not into drama and other things concerning the human emotion of "Love" in books. <br>
      Now someone could argue that this is a good way to learn what different people went through but, the purpose <br>
      here is to inform rater than entertain. So no, I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone as it is extremely <br>
      time wasting in terms of the overall efficiency on learning about the subject.
